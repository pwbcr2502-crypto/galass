## Auto-create Pull Request
1. Please create a Pull Request from the current branch (e.g., dev) to the main branch.
2. PR title: "Enhance DevPM module"
3. Auto-generate the PR description based on the code changes.
4. Push the branch to GitHub if it's not yet pushed.

### Standard Workflow  
1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.  
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them.  
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.  
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.  
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high-level explanation of what changes you made.  
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possibleâ€”we want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.  
7. Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.

8. Please check through all the code you just write and make sure it follows security best practices. Make sure no sensitive information is in the front end and there are no vulnerabilities people can exploit.

9. Please explain the functionality and code you just built out in detail. Walk me through what you changed and how it works, Act like you're an expert engineer teaching me code.

10. Record the contents of each modification in the log.md file after every change.
